# Compounding Engineering Plugin Development

## Versioning Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Every change to this plugin MUST include updates to all three files:

1. **`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`** - Bump version using semver
2. **`CHANGELOG.md`** - Document changes using Keep a Changelog format
3. **`README.md`** - Verify/update component counts and tables

### Version Bumping Rules

- **MAJOR** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes, major reorganization
- **MINOR** (1.0.0 → 1.1.0): New agents, commands, or skills
- **PATCH** (1.0.0 → 1.0.1): Bug fixes, doc updates, minor improvements

### Pre-Commit Checklist

Before committing ANY changes:

- [ ] Version bumped in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with changes
- [ ] README.md component counts verified
- [ ] README.md tables accurate (agents, commands, skills)
- [ ] plugin.json description matches current counts

### Directory Structure

```
agents/
├── review/     # Code review agents (6)
├── research/   # Research and analysis agents (4)
└── workflow/   # Workflow automation agents (3)

commands/
├── workflows/  # Core workflow commands (mantle:plan, mantle:review, etc.)
└── lfg.md      # Autonomous workflow orchestrator

skills/
└── */          # Each skill in its own directory (11 skills)
```

## Command Naming Convention

**Workflow commands** use `mantle:` prefix to avoid collisions with built-in commands:
- `/mantle:plan` - Create implementation plans
- `/mantle:review` - Run comprehensive code reviews
- `/mantle:work` - Execute work items systematically
- `/mantle:compound` - Document solved problems
- `/lfg` - Autonomous workflow orchestrator

**Why `mantle:`?** Claude Code has built-in `/plan` and `/review` commands. Using `name: mantle:plan` in frontmatter creates a unique `/mantle:plan` command with no collision.

## Skill Compliance Checklist

When adding or modifying skills, verify compliance with skill-creator spec:

### YAML Frontmatter (Required)

- [ ] `name:` present and matches directory name (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- [ ] `description:` present and uses **third person** ("This skill should be used when..." NOT "Use this skill when...")

### Reference Links (Required if references/ exists)

- [ ] All files in `references/` are linked as `[filename.md](./references/filename.md)`
- [ ] All files in `assets/` are linked as `[filename](./assets/filename)`
- [ ] All files in `scripts/` are linked as `[filename](./scripts/filename)`
- [ ] No bare backtick references like `` `references/file.md` `` - use proper markdown links

### Writing Style

- [ ] Use imperative/infinitive form (verb-first instructions)
- [ ] Avoid second person ("you should") - use objective language ("To accomplish X, do Y")

### Quick Validation Command

```bash
# Check for unlinked references in a skill
grep -E '`(references|assets|scripts)/[^`]+`' skills/*/SKILL.md
# Should return nothing if all refs are properly linked

# Check description format
grep -E '^description:' skills/*/SKILL.md | grep -v 'This skill'
# Should return nothing if all use third person
```
